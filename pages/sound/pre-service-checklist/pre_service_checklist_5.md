## Steps:

1. Collect the wireless mics, remove the batteries and set them in the charger, and pack away all of the transmitters, lavaliers, and head-booms.
2. Remember how we copied the scene before service?  That means we don't have to save it to the NV Base because we didn't change the NV Base.
3. Power Off the QU-32 Console.
4. Power Off the wireless microphone receivers.
5. Clean up the work-space and discard any programs or printouts that no longer apply.
