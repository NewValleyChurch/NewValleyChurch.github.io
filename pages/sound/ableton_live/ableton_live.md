## Basics

New Valley uses Ableton Live for various automation functions for events and services.

Ableton Live's power lies in its ability to route and synchronize audio and MIDI data, record MIDI data, and record audio data.

## Two Locations

1.  We use Ableton Live on stage to generate click tracks and band cues for the musician's in-ear monitors.
2.  We also use Ableton Live at Front of House to record audio input from a single or multiple audio inputs.

Ableton Live can be run in Master/Slave mode whereby one computer is setup as the master clock, and other computers take cues from the master to synchronize multiple instances of Ableton Live.  This allows us to distribute the work-load across multiple systems.

## Audio

Pre-recorded audio clips of various lengths can be played in time with the main MIDI clock.  

Ableton Live is a very powerful <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.DAW}}">DAW</a> that we currently use for two purposes:

1. Record and store Sermons during services.
2. Automate and control DMX lighting through the DMXIS control module.

It records both audio and MIDI data and is a powerful automation and arrangement tool.

{% include callout.html content="The direction we can move with Ableton Live will empower us to do more with less hands.  Between multiple computers running Ableton Live, synchronized via MIDI networking, we can integrate automations into the entire worship experience to not only power the actual worship songs, but also to control lighting, audio effects, and video.  <br/><br/>**Example:** At the start of any given service, we typically have some sort of background music rolling for ambience.  In the future, when the worship band triggers their first song, Ableton Live will be able to automatically fade out the house music, dim the lights, and make room for the band to provide a seamless and consistent experience every time." type="primary" %}
