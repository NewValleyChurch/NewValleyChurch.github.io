## Introduction

Whether we use backing tracks (stems) or a simple click, this guide will explain from start to finish how a song is arranged and configured in Ableton Live.

## Library of Songs

Our library of songs is stored in a single Ableton Project file called New Valley Worship.  Some of those songs are full arrangements with backing tracks, others are simply tied to a tempo, time signature, and click.  Ultimately, the goal is to have each song arranged as we play it with the freedom to repeat sections on the fly, offering the option of spontaneity.

The current library reflects a list of songs that we have performed since implementing our in-ear system and since we began using a click track.  If a song is not in the library, it means we haven't performed it with Ableton Live.

## Process - From Concept to Congregation

From the decision to either replicate a song, or write an original song, the process of migrating those ideas to Ableton Live contains _many_ steps to ensure flawless execution.  There are a lot of moving pieces, but once you understand how they integrate with each other, it will become easier to go from **concept-to-congregation**.

## Steps - Outline

The following is a brief list of the main phases of this process.

1.  Record the Original Song into Ableton Live.
2.  Establish the recording's Flow.
3.  Create the Band Guide clip.
4.  Create the Follow Scene Clip.
5.  Create OnSong Clips for Song reference and automated navigation.
6.  Create the Band Guide Repeat clip.
7.  Create the DMX Lighting Cue Clip
8.  Create the MainStage Patch Automation Clip.
9.  Create the MainStage Continuous Control Clip.
10. Consolidate arrangement sections to new Scenes.
11. Label Scenes.
12. Perform.

## Steps - In Detail

#### 1. Record the Original Song

1. Set the Output Device for the computer to SoundFlower Channel 2.
2. Open Ableton Live.
3. In the Ableton File Browser, open the set entitled "NV Default Setup.als"
4. In Ableton, go to Live -> Preferences.  Under the audio tab, choose SoundFlower as the input device.
5. In the current project set, you should see a group called "Originals" and an audio track in that group called "Original Song."  Arm that track by clicking the button at the bottom of the track with the circle in it.
6. Set Monitor to Auto on that same track.
7. Open the source of your recording, whether it's YouTube or Spotify, or another source.  Get it ready.  Cue up the song you're about to record.
8. Play a few seconds of the song to confirm that you're receiving a signal in the "Original Song" track and that you can hear it.  If you cannot hear the song, something is wrong.
10. While the song is playing, use the TAP button in the upper left-hand corner of the screen to tap the tempo you hear.  It does not have to be exact, but the closer it is, the better.  Make sure you adjust the output level of the player you're using so Ableton Live is receiving a good signal.
11. Once you have a tempo, round the tempo to the nearest whole number and manually change it by typing it in.
12. Rewind the original and cue it up again.
13. Stop all clips in Session View using the little square icon just above the Cue Out section in the Master Channel in Ableton Live.
14. Switch to Arrangement View (Tab on the keyboard) in Ableton Live.
15. Make sure that you can see the "Original Song" track in your view.
16. Double click the transport STOP button to return the transport to measure 1 of the arrangement (1.1.1).
17. At the top of the screen, set the quantization to '1 Bar' if it is not already set.  This gives you a 1 bar count-in.  Being on tempo is not important when you're recording the original.  You can adjust warp markers after the song is recorded.
18. Press Record on the transport.  Wait for the count-in to complete, then switch to YouTube or Spotify, or whatever other source you're using.
19. Start playing the song you want to record.  Any superfluous audio can be edited out after the song completes (such as advertisements, etc.)
20. When the song is complete, stop the transport.
21. In Arrangement view, click the colored header part of the clip that was just created in the Original Song track.
22. Press Command-R and rename the clip "Song Name - Artist Name"
23. At the bottom of the screen, you should see the Sample envelope.  If you don't, there's a little circle icon with a squiggly in it at the very bottom left of the Ableton Live screen.  Make sure this is lit up.  If it is already on, then you should be able to see a small info section called "Sample" just above and to the right of the squiggly circle icon.
24. Below the arrangement view, you should see a timeline for the clip you've selected.
25.
