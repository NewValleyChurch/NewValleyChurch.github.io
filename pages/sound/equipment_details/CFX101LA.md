                    <p>We currently have 5 speakers at FOH that are considered the Main speakers.  These are the cabinets that contain the speakers.  There are 2 2-speaker arrays, one stage left, and one stage right, and a single center channel.</p>
                    <p>**From the manufacturer's website:** Designed for power, portability and versatility, the CF101LA and CFX101LA from Renkus-Heinz is the ideal solution for today's small and mid-sized venues, including auditoria, night clubs, theaters and houses of worship. With the flexibility to be flown, ground-stacked or pole-mounted, the CF101LA and CFX101LA delivers the performance and pattern control of a line array, with the clarity of a point source system, in a compact, sleek and affordable design that's equally at home as a portable system or a permanent installation.</p>
