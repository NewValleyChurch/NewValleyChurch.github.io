Lists are collections of people that fit a specific criteria set by you.  When you create a list, you choose various attributes and voila!  A list of people.

Lists answer questions like:

- Who's a member?
- Which `members` are `female` or `male`
- Of the `men` who aren't `members` at the `chandler` campus, which ones registered for the men's retreat last year?
- Which members are `kids` and which ones aren't?

**Be intentional with list creation so there's a purpose to it.**

Lists can be organized into categories to keep them clear.  Remember, we always want to name and organize digital resources so they are intuitive and self-evident in their purpose without being redundant.

Lists aren't ONLY used for the purpose of communications, but that is one of the most powerful features.  Once a list is created, it can be pushed to Mailchimp where it will be turned into a static segment.

Once a list has been turned into a segment, e-mail campaigns in their wide variety can be sent to just those subscribers.

## How PCO Lists Integrate with Mailchimp

When you sync a PCO list to Mailchimp, a `static` segment is created.  If someone is already on the mailing list, they are added to the segment, _unless_ they have unsubscribed, in which case they are not added.

If someone in PCO is _not_ on the Mailchimp list, they will automatically be subscribed to the mailing list and will be added to the segment.

If a list is created in PCO, and the same person is found on more than one list (example, you're a member AND you attended last year's conference) then you will be added to both segments on Mailchimp under a single subscriber instance.

PCO does not sync Groups on Mailchimp.  Only segments.

If a list is deleted from PCO, the corresponding segment is **not** removed from Mailchimp.  That must be done manually.  If you delete a segment from Mailchimp it does **not** remove the subscribers from PCO nor does it remove them from the Mailchimp list or any other segments they may be part of.

From Mailchimp, you cannot look up a single subscriber to see which segments they are part of.  You must do that through PCO's list feature.
