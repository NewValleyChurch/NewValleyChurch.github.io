There may be a time when you notice that the mouse cursor pauses, interrupting your work-flow.  If this is happening, it is most likely due to one of the connections to an external display.

One way to try to remedy the problem is to unplug the Stage Display USB to HDMI connector, wait a few seconds for the system to recognize that it's gone, and then re-connect it.

If this doesn't help the problem, the same may need to be done with the Matrox DualHead2Go connector.
