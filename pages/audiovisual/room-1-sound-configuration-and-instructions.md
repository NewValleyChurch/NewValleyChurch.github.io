## About the Sound System
A basic sound system has been installed in room 1 in the Kids building which provide the ability to play anything overhead that may or may not accompany a projected video, etc.

There are a few basic components that make up the system.

1. Mixer
2. Amplifier
3. Connection Cable
4. Input Device (iMac / iPad / Walkman / Discman / Microhpone, etc.)

## iMac Details

The iMac is setup to automatically login to a user account called `NVKids`.  If you are presented with a login screen, leave the password field blank.  If the computer is off, just turn it on and it will boot to the desktop.

### Projector

- The projector, when turned on, becomes a 2nd monitor for the iMac.  In order to display anything on the projector, the projector must first be turned on, then whatever you're playing must be opened and dragged to the left (logically as the screen is to the left when facing the iMac.) The projector is basically a 2nd monitor for the computer. 

- After dragging any browser or media player to the projector screen, simply go full-screen on any video you're playing and you'll have a full projection.

## How To Use
Whether you have your own sound source, or you're using the iMac in place, setting up the sound is simple.

1. Turn on the Projector.  If you don't have access to the Harmony remote which resides in the `Living Room` in the main building, use a pole or someone really tall to reach up and turn on the power.  If you do have the Harmony remote, browse to the correct device on the Harmony remote's screen and choose it, then use the power up option on the remote.
1. Turn on the iMac.
1. Make sure that all of the faders on the mixer (those are the sliders towards the bottom of the board) are all the way down.  This is simply a precaution to prevent any media that might already be playing to blast its way through the speakers.
1. Turn on the `PreSonus` mixer board.
1. The amplifier, which is a small gray box labeled `Extron` is already powered up.  It _stays on and doesn't need to be turned off._
1. You can insert a DVD into the iMac or use Chrome to browse to a media site like `YouTube` or `Vimeo` to find your media source.
1. Start your Video or Spotify, or whatever media player you're using.
1. **Note:  Before you adjust the faders on the mixer to make it louder, make sure that the volume control on your media player (iTunes / Spotify / Etc. ) is set to approximately 80% of max volume.**
1. Bring the MAIN fader on the mixer (all the way to the right) up to unity gain.  That's the little white area about 2/3 of the way up.  Line it up with Zero.
1. Now, slowly slide the input fader(s) channel 1 & 2 up on the mixer board until you hear whatever it is you're playing.

Channels 1 & 2 are the iMac. More channels can be used, but it's unlikely you'll need to.

**NOTE: Whatever you do, don't adjust any other volume input controls or output controls.  Stick to your device's volume first (iMac / iPad / Etc.), then the channel 1 & 2 faders on the mixer, and the main fader on the mixer.**
