_**This is the in-depth process explaining how a song is prepared for worship.**_

{% include callout.html content="There's a set in Ableton Live entitled '[NV Master Worship Template](brokenlink.html)' that you will be using to begin preparing a song.  It is part of the '[New Valley Worship Project](brokenlink.html)' which is the main Ableton Live project file that all of our sets are stored in." style="info" %}

## Step 1: Record the Original Song into Ableton Live

{% include callout.html content="This process assumes you don't already have a local copy of the original recording in digital format." style="warning" %}

1. Open Ableton Live, then open the NV Master Worship Template.als file.
2. Switch to Arrangement view if you aren't already there. (View -> Toggle Arrangement/Session View)
3. Find the track labeled "Original Song."
4. Arm the Track.
5. Set your system audio output to [SoundFlower (2ch)](brokenlink.html).
6. Set Ableton Live's Audio input preferences (Live --> Preferences --> Audio) to [SoundFlower (2ch)](brokenlink.html).
7. Play the song you want to record from YouTube or Spotify. If you have a copy of the file in iTunes, you may be able to simply import the file into Ableton Live and bypass this entire process.
8. While the song is playing, in Ableton Live, Tap out the tempo (upper left corner) and then round to the nearest value. This aids the warping process. Also, ensure you have set the audio level high enough on the player.  There's a "loop" icon at the top of Ableton Live.  Make sure that it is not lit up.  Click it to turn it off if it is.
9. Now that the tempo is set, you can rewind the song and cue it up at the beginning. Once you've done that, in Ableton Live, click the Record button on the transport and wait for the count-in to complete.
10. Switch back to your song and start playing it again.

Ableton Live is now recording the song into a clip in the arrangement view.

11. Once the song is complete, stop the recording process and turn off your source player.

Congratulations, you have now
