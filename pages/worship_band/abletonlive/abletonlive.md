## Ableton Live

Ableton Live is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) used to record and play back both audio and MIDI data.  Our band currently uses Ableton Live to synchronize in ear click tracks, some lighting cues, and [piano automation](#piano-automation).

## Preparing a New Song for Worship

This is an [extensive process](preparingasongforworship.html) that must be completed for each individual arrangement of a given song, assuming there is any need for automation or any need for pre-recorded tracks for the song.

In the case where we have a simple click with and no need for intricate scene changes, lyrics changes, lighting cues, or patch changes for the keyboard, [this process](brokenlink.html) is much simpler.

### [In Depth Process](preparingasongforworship.html)

{% include callout.html content="<strong>Note:</strong> it is important to know that without automation, lyrics need to be manually controlled.  With automation, we can pre-program a flawless transition between songs and song sections, ensuring there is never a discrepancy between what we're singing and what's being displayed on the screens, as well as save valuable time when it comes down to crunch time." type="warning" %}

## Piano Automation

{% include callout.html content="<strong>Regarding Piano Automations:</strong> The most critical aspect of a seamless performance from the start of the song to the end is the ability to transition smoothly between parts on the piano.  With the right preparation, Ableton Live can be configured to automatically move from one instrument to the next, freeing up the hands of the keyboardist to simply play their parts, provided parts have been defined and learned." type="primary" %}
