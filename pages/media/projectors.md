## Powering the Projectors

We have two projectors.  Each projector is powered independently.  The projectors must be turned on or off remotely, either by using the hand-held remote, or by using a web browser.

### Remote

Using a remote control, stand under each projector and power them up one at a time.  Same process for shut-down, except that the shut-down requires two presses of the power button.

### Web Browser

Or, you could stay where you are and point your web browser to both of these addresses:

- [Projector 1](http://192.168.1.110)
- [Projector 2](http://192.168.1.111)

These addresses are bookmarked in Chrome.  If you use this method, you will need to use the Media Team password to access the interface.  The projectors can also be shut down using this interface.

## Configuration

The projectors are blended using a blending add-on in Pro-Presenter coupled with a hardware device known as the DualHead2Go by Matrox.  

The DualHead2Go effectively appears in the iMac as a single desktop (System Preferences -> Displays -> Arrangement) but it actually splits the output from the iMac into two separate images.  

Those two images overlap each other by 240 pixels.  Both projectors are projecting at 1920X1200 which creates a canvas of 3840X1200 but because there's a blend of 240 pixels, the actual size of the image displayed is 3600X1200.
