                <p>Most iMacs can support multiple monitors by creating additional desktops, each with their own background settings, that can be situated next to each other to create a larger workspace.  With multiple monitors, you can see more, do more, etc., all from the same computer</p><p><h3>This Device:</h3></p><p>This device is a single display adapter that adds a single desktop to the iMac, but it splits the desktop into two independent feeds that can span multiple monitors.</p><p>At New Valley, we have two projectors that display a single, wide image, with a 240 pixel overlap which is blended.  The DualHead2Go allows us to achieve the aspect ratio that we can while maintaining a short projector throw.</p><p>If we attempted to achieve the same dimensions with a single projector, we would need it to be much further from the projection surface, and that comes with reduced brightness, and the problem of obstacles in the way, like lighting, and duct work.</p>
