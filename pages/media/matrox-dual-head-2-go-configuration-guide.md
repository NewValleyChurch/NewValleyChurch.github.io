The Matrox Dual Head 2 Go needs a specific driver and management application called Matrox Powerdesk in order to be configured properly.  Assuming you are starting from scratch, the following steps will ensure you have installed and setup the device correctly.

(**Note:** Additional modules are configured in ProPresenter to ensure this device operates as intended.)

## Matrox Powerdesk Setup

- Install Matrox Powerdesk
- Connect DualHead2Go MINIDV connector and USB Connector
- In display settings (Quick setup), select `On iMac display` and `To the right of the iMac display` in the `Location` selections.
- Confirm that the Display settings read `2 * 1920x1200 60 Hz (r)`
- Apply and confirm.
- Confirm System Preferences --> Displays --> Arrangement shows the correct number of displays.
- In Mission Control, (System Preferences --> Mission Control) ensure that `Displays have separate spaces` is _disabled_.
- Restart the computer.

That's it.  Now you'll need to make sure that ProPresenter is setup correctly.
