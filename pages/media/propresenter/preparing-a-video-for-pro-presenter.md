Steps:

# When the Video dimensions are smaller than the screen.

## Create the Video Document

1. Obtain highest quality copy of original or rendered original as possible.
2. Save the file to /Volumes/Blue/ProPresenter/Video
3. In ProPresenter, create a new Video Document.
    - Click File -> New
    - Name the Document (Example: Gospel Project for Kids)  The word "Video" does not need to be in the document title as that would be redundant.
    - Choose a template for the video.  Click the template dropdown, select from Video & Photo Frames, choose the appropriate template for the series / layout.
    - Select the "Video" category.
    - Leave the size at 3600X1200

## Set the Slide Cues for the first slide

This will depend on what you want to have happen.

1. Open the cue palette (Shift-CTRL-C) or right click the slide -> Add Cue -> Cue Palette.
1. Clear the appropriate elements from whatever was last displayed by dragging each cue from the cue palette to the first slide in the document.
1. If there are any backgrounds unique to this video, use the Media Cue "Graphic" to browse to the Images folder (/Volumes/Blue/ProPresenter/Images).  If you chose a video template that already has a static background that we use regularly, you don't need additional graphics.
1. Add a stage display cue that's appropriate for this point in the service.
1. Add a timer cue and choose an appropriate timer countdown with the action "Reset and Start Timer"
1. Add any prop cues that apply such as logos, transparent overlays, etc.
1. Add any masks, messages or social media cues that apply.
1. Close the Cue Palette

## Add the Video to the Slide

{% include important.html content="test" %}

# When the Video is created to be exactly the size of the screen.
