{% include note.html content="All WIFI thermostats can be programmed via a web or mobile app interface." %}

This page deals with the core hardware configuration settings for the thermostats.

## System Setup

To get to these settings:

- Press and hold SYSTEM on the left hand side for an arbitrary time period until, when released, something on the screen changes.
- Press and hold the blank center square at the bottom of the screen to enter System Mode.

{% include important.html content="The wrong settings here can have adverse effects on the system.  Never change 0710 to 1...ever, under any circumstance.  If you do, the entire thermostat will need to be reconfigured from scratch." %}

## Settings Unique to New Valley

Under system setup, the following are the only settings we need to be concerned about unless the thermostat has been completely reset:

|Function|Should be|
|---|---|
|0112|52|
|0120 - 0150|Automatically set by internet|
|0160|4|
|0165|0|
|0170|2|
|0280|0|
|0330|0|
|0530|1|
|0890|1|
|0900|1 (Will be automatically set to 1 if connected to the WIFI router.)|
