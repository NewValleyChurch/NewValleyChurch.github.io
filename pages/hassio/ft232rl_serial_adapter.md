## What Is This?

This is a micro controller that allows you to connect your small electronics projects such as the Sonoff WIFI Switch to your computer via USB.  It is simply a USB to Serial Adapter.  Connecting it requires knowing what pins are used, and what voltage requirements your device has.

The jumper on the board near the pins can be set for 5V or 3.3V.  Make sure you've set it to the right setting before connecting it to whatever device it's going to be connected to.  Setting it is as simple as moving the jumper from one side to the other.
