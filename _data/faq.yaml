- question: How do we control the lights from the QU-32?
  answer: >-
    Currently there is no mapped connection between the QU-32 and the iMac. 
    Lights are controlled remotely by a MIDI network connection from the stage,
    or manually by choosing a pre-set in the DMXIS software.

    How do I listen to what's been recorded in Ableton Live without sending it
    through FOH?
  answer: >-
    Set the AFL Output setting to OFF in the PAFL settings screen and you'll
    hear everything pre-fader.  This allows you to listen to whatever is being
    sent to the board without sending it to the DSP.  See page 22 of the QU-32
    Manual.

- question: What is DMX?
  answer: >-
    DMX is a lighting signal protocol used to control various channels of
    lights.  Our system contains one DMX universe which will operate up to 512
    channels.  Each light, depending on its manufacturer, will use at least one,
    but usually multiple channels.

- question: What is FOH?
  answer: >-
    FOH stands for Front of House.  Draw a vertical boundary from the apron of
    the stage to the ceiling.  Anything from that point to the back of the
    sanctuary is considered Front of House.

  answer: >-
    The apron is the part of the stage that curves.  Draw a line parallel to the
    back of the stage from where the curve stops across the stage.  Anything in
    front of that line is the apron.
