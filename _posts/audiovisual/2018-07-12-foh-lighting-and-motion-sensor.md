Good evening everyone.  This is an update regarding a feature that was implemented in the Sanctuary.  Today a sensor was installed near the Stage Display in the Sanctuary which will detect motion, light, and as a bonus, temperature and humidity.  The important components are the motion and light sensors.  If it ever rains in the sanctuary, we'll have bigger problems.

Upon triggering the motion sensor, which will only happen within a limited radius around the center door in the back of the sanctuary, a light strip will light up the floor of the A/V Booth so you can see where you're going.  So, as you pass through the doorway, or pass by the doorway, the sensor will trigger the light to turn on.

The light will only turn on if the lighting level in the sanctuary is below a specific level, which is what the light sensor is for.  The light strip will automatically turn off if one of the two conditions are met:

1. The light level in the sanctuary increases above a set threshold,
1. 5 Minutes have passed.

The motion sensor will not re-trigger the lights unless it's still too dark in the Sanctuary.  In the event that we need a darkened sanctuary for an event, we can adjust the light sensor to be more precise.

Lookout for more automations coming soon.
