Awesome developments over the past few weeks are leading us towards a much better lighting solution for the sanctuary at New Valley Chandler!

Here's what's going on.

We've put together and executed the inital stages of the lighting installation which will include:

- 19 Elation SixPar 200 LED lights.
- 1 Enttec Playback Wing, console for lighting control.
- Mac Workstation dedicated to lighting control with QLC+ Lighting software as the basis of the connection.
- Ethernet to DMX converter to remove the dependency on USB to DMX.  This will allow us to make a mobile or remote connection to the lighting system so we can provide easier control of the house lights without interference with the lighting console.
    - Imagine walking into the sanctuary and having the house lights detect your presence.
- New rigging and [new positioning for the lights](lighting-design-and-layout.html), including 10 lights front of house, 5 lights over the stage, and 2 lights throwing light laterally across the stage from behind the storage wings.

In addition to the stage lighting, we will be adding lights inside of the storage wings and in the hallways behind the storage wings.

Parts have been ordered and we should be expecting everything to be here before the end of next week at which point installation will commence.  The project timeline was originally slated for a completion date of August 1st.  If we're lucky, we'll get 70% of the way there by then, but we need to make some modifications to the acoustic panels over the stage to accomodate the lighting in relation to the projector beam, which we cannot interrupt.  Shadows on the screen would be a bad thing.  At the bare minimum, we'll have the front facing wash lights up and running for Scott's first sermon back from sabbatical.

At least one Lumanet switch panel is planned, which is basically a fancy electronic wall-mounted switch that can be used to turn the lights on if someone absolutely needs to press a button on the wall.  If Home Assistant can be integrated with the Ethernet DMX converter then we may be able to incorporate a small tablet device as the control panel on the wall to turn on/off the house lights at certain times instead of the Lumanet switch.  The tablet will be able to do far more than just a simple light switch.

Learning the QLC+ software is going to take some time.  To prepare for this, we'll be creating some basic controls and cues that we can use right away, and as we progress, we will be able to get creative with the lights, setting up cues for specific songs, and triggering those cues from Ableton Live or ProPresenter.

As soon as I have some light renderings ready, I'll post them to the site.
