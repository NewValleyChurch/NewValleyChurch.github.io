## Good News
Project _Stage Display_ is taking a major leap forward.

There will soon be a much more powerful, much more up-to-date iMac (27" instead of 21.5") for the media team to use during services and events.

Our current iMac is a 2011 model with a USB 2.0 BUS which limits us to the number of external displays we can effectively use.  While it's touted that we can use 2 additional displays, this is not actually the case because of software limitations.

So, the new iMac will have an updated USB 3.0 Bus _and_ 2 Mini-Display ports.

## Why this matters...
ProPresenter's Stage Display feature hasn't been utilized...ever...at New Valley.  We are entering a new age.  The Stage Display will allow us to bring important information to the stage and/or any other location where we need to know the flow of the service in real time.  Most importantly, to begin with, a clock timer that is in sync with the service timing.

## Slow and Steady
Utilizing the Stage Display to its fullest potential will take time.  For instance, we won't have an immediate way to deliver a video feed _to_ the actual stage, but will in the future.  For now, getting it up and running is priority, which I'm working on.

## Migration
I'll be migrating everything from one iMac to the next, keeping all configuration settings to be as familiar as can be, with minimal changes (ehem...)  As soon as the new system is up and running, I'll send out another announcement about it along with any instructions regarding changes that have been made.
