## Success!
The stage display feed is up and running, and the playlist has been updated for tomorrow's service to include layout and timer cues on the first slides in each item in the playlist.

All of the technical problems have been ironed out and we now have a platform to work with.

After working with the settings and options, it's become clear that the stage display's full utilization involves displaying information for those on stage that we wouldn't want to display to the congregation (i.e. the TV on the back wall.)

In the future, a design draft will be created to implement displays "on" stage where the presenters and musicians will actually be able to read them.

Until then...enjoy!
