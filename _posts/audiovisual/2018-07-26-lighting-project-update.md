A quick update on the lighting project:

-	// Shipment of the lights has been delayed due to a product back-order at the manufacturer.  Estimated shipment arrival is now August 8th, 2018 which puts us behind schedule, but we're still on the right track.  The up-side is that it will allow us a bit more time to put together and fine-tune a software layout design that's going to be intuitive.

-	// Pipe and rigging will be hung as soon as the timing on scaffolding aligns with the lights arriving, so we can save on scaffold rental.

-	// The DMXIS USB to DMX hardware that we've been using will be replaced with what's called an ArtNet connection.  Basically, instead of being connected directly to the computer, the lighting controller will be connected to the network switch and will be controlled just like any other network device.  One less USB port to worry about.

-	// DMXIS software will be deprecated.  In lieu of the DMXIS control that we've become semi-familiar with, we will be utilizing an open source platform called QLC+.  I am currently in the process of designing a lighting control layout that we can use.  There is flexibility in the design.  We can build whatever we all find necessary to accomplish the vision.

## Some Notes on QLC+

We will have all sorts of control capabilities with this software.  Not only will be be able to control it with a standard keyboard / mouse configuration, we will also be able to design a TouchOSC interface for the iPad, allowing us touch access to scenes and functions and we'll be able to connect to the lighting system through the network, which will give us the ability to automate some basic house lighting functions, such as turning on lights for cleaning teams, etc.  Ableton Live will be able to trigger scenes as well.  

QLC+ will need to be running on its own workstation, as it does not support full screen mode in tandem with a multiple projection system.  So there will be another computer needed for Front of House.

## Some other things to expect:

- ProPresenter slides can trigger lighting scene selections.
- Ableton Live from the stage will be able to trigger lighting scene selections.
- Ableton Live will be able to call up documents in ProPresenter and automatically transition between lyrics.
- We will have an unlimited number of lighting scenes that we can create for any scenario, whether it be a one time event, or an every-Sunday type of scene.
- The freedom to create just the right feeling and mood with the lights that we'll have will be unlimited.
- We will be able to light up the communion table properly.
- The cross will have a front accent light.
- All of the fixtures we're installing will have barn doors on them to sculpt the beams of light just the way we want them to prevent unwanted shadows or bleed.
- Diffusers will be installed on some of the lights to expand the beam angles and provide a greater stage wash.
- Lights will be in the boom position on stage offering us side lighting to help provide a sense of depth to the stage.
- We will have a physical control board connected to the network which will communicate directly with QLC+ to map certain keys to scene functions providing quick one touch access to lighting setups.
