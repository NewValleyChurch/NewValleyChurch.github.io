A few things have happened in the sound booth over the past week or so.  

- Toe kick LED light strip was installed under the cabinets.  It has a dimmer on it, but its on/off function is completely automated.  Next step, install motion sensor to trigger lights when someone walks into a dark sanctuary.  The light will illuminate the floor.  As soon as the house lights are brought up, the light will automatically turn off.
- Power strip was installed under the iMac.  Unfortunately, it was too wide at first, so it was modified to fit between the counter-top brackets.  The power cord was modified to fit the required distance to the power outlet under the iMac.
- A desk lamp was placed behind the iMac.  Whether temporary or not, it is there right now and is also connected to the automation system.

## Upcoming Changes / Modifications / To Do Items

- Install PIR and Temperature Sensor in high traffic areas to trigger floor light.
- Re-position and re-wire all hardware under the counter-top to minimize its footprint and maximize ease of maintenance.
