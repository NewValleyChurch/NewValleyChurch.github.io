Good morning!  Every day I make little steps towards improvements to the documentation for New Valley.  One of the areas that we need work on is the pre-service checklist(s).

So, I need your help when you're able, which may be while you're between services on a Sunday when you're at the media computer or the sound console.

We need a basic flight plan / checklist / instruction sequence or whatever you want to call it for anyone to be able to follow when they're handling the media or sound.

## How can I help?

Let's make a master list.  I've started a basic bullet point list [here.](/audiovisual.html).  We'll consider this page the staging grounds for what will become a much more robust checklist in the future.  For now, a simple list will do.

I envision a checklist of basic steps that's organized like the [equipment lists.](/equipment_list_sound.html)  Each step may have a priority, and each step may have a link to a much more detailed explanation about that particular step and perhaps even a YouTube screen-cast tutorial so you can watch it happen.

## You can suggest edits to the list.
#### Here's how:

1. Go to the [A/V Team Overview](/audiovisual.html) page.
2. Once you're there, click the "Edit Me" button at the top of the page.  You will be redirected to GitHub.
3. If you don't yet have a GitHub account, make an account, it's free.  Then, let me know what you used for your account name.
4. Once you're able to login to GitHub, you'll see something that looks like this after clicking Edit Me:![](/images/githubeditme1.jpg)
5. Click the pencil in the edit window.![](/images/githubeditme2.jpg)
6. Make your suggested changes by adding to or removing from the page.![](/images/githubeditme3.jpg)
7. At the bottom of the page where you see "Commit Changes", add a short description and then click the Propose file Change button.

That's it.  I'll receive a notification and I'll review the changes and incorporate them into the website.

Hint:  The Edit Me button on every page of our website allows you to suggest corrections or changes without actually changing the site.
