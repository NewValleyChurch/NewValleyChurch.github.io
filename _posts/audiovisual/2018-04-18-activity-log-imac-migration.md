This is a rather comprehensive log of actions that were taken to implement the new iMac for Media.  It may melt your face off if you read all of it.  The short of it is that we now have a newer 27" iMac in place of the older 21" iMac.  It has been configured to utilize a 3rd external display which will feed the Stage Display signal to wherever we please.

The downloads folder is automatically purged every 24 hours, so if you download something, know that it needs to have a home or it will need to be downloaded again.

The following page was added to the site:  [Matrox DualHead2Go Video Display Adapter](DualH2GDME.html) along with the [configuration instructions](matrox-dual-head-2-go-configuration-guide.html).

### ProPresenter Media

Images, Videos, and Audio files that are utilized in ProPresenter are automatically stored in the media repository as configured in ProPresenter.  This means that when you drag a resource to the image/background bin, it is _copied_ to the media repository.

**Note:** If the file you are dragging into ProPresenter _is a duplicate of the original artwork_ make sure you delete the duplicate.

We will be developing a catalog standard and naming convention as well as a network repository independent of ProPresenter to store NVC digital media files so they're available to us regardless of whether or not they'll be used in ProPresenter or some other publication(s).  That is a work in planning, currently.
