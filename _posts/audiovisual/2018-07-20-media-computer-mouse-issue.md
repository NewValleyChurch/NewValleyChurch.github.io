summary: "How to stop the mouse from stuttering on the iMac MediaOne workstation"
---

## Problem

Periodically, in 8-10 second intervals, the mouse on the iMac seems to get stuck for a split second, disrupting the workflow.  After investigating the problem, it has been determined that it is related to external monitors.

## How to Cause the Problem

The Matrox DualHead2Go, when connected, splits the desktop and sends it to both projectors.  If the projectors are off, the mouse will stutter.

## How to Fix the Problem

At any point, there are three things you can do to stop the mouse from interrupting the workflow.

- Disconnect the DualHead2Go USB connector from the iMac.  (Not recommended, but it works.) Reconnect when you intend to present with the projectors.
- Turn the projectors on.  For some reason, if the 2nd desktop is connected and powered up, but the projectors are off, the mouse misbehaves.
- Use mind control instead of the mouse.  If you can figure this one out, bravo.
