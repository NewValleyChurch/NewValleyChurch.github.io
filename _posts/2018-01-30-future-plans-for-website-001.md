There are quite literally billions of things that we can do with this site.  Here are a few of my ideas that I'll be rolling forward with to continue to provide great content that helps you get what you need to do done.

- **Screenshots and photos:**  All of this documentation is great, but if there are no photos, illustrations, etc., then it all gets quite boring and we don't want boring.

- **Video:**  I'm working on another side project that I've named "Cue the Sound."  Or, was it..."Cue the Audio?"  Either way, it will be a YouTube channel that will contain videos of tutorials, screencasts, etc., designed to walk just about anyone through the processes we go through.

- **Inventory:**  We really don't know what we have in "stock" around here.  Assembling an inventory of all of our cabling, equipment, etc., is going to make it easier to manage it if and when it fails.

- **Power Up / Power Down Automation:**  This one is a bit exciting and might take a while, but the cost is very low (aside from man-hours).  Basically, the vision is to implement an automatic power up / power down sequence for the equipment that's important.  It will all be tied into an automation server which will be accessible anywhere in the world by the right people.  In addition to power control, the system is extremely versatile and robust and will allows us to integrate nearly every system and piece of hardware we have.  
  - Automated File backup and management.
  - Light control based upon devices and schedules.
  - Centralized remote access to all wireless thermostats.
  - Honestly, the list goes on and on.  If you're interested in knowing more about the platform, head over to [Home-Assistant.io](http://home-assistant.io) for more information.
