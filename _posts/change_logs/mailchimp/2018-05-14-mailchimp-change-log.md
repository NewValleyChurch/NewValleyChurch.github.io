## List Cleanup

- Deleted 2 old outdated lists.
  - New Valley - Ahwatukee (Breeze) which contained 305 subscribers and was an outdated list.
  - NV Students (Master List)

- New Valley - Downtown (Breeze Sync) seems to have been used recently and it cannot yet be deleted.
- Renamed list `New Valley` to `New Valley Church Master Database`.
- Integrated Mailchimp with Planning Center Online.

- Created a list called `Members` and tested synchronization.  Members who have unsubscribed are not synchronized to the list.
- Synchronization creates a `static` segment at Mailchimp.
- Updated the main logo on Mailchimp.
