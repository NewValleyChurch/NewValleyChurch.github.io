- Created this activity log.
- Added the iMac at Front of House to [I.T. Equipment Inventory](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/I.T.-Equipment-Inventory)
- Downloaded OSX High Sierra for the FOH iMac upgrade.
- Installed Disk Inventory X on the FOH iMac due to the limited amount of space on the primary disk.  In order to update the OS we will need to identify what is taking up most of the space and re-organize files.
- Scanned iMac Hard Drive
- Located 154GB of old audio that was captured by the QU-32 from the old location.
- Moved all captured files to external hard-drive Blue.
- Installed OSX High Sierra on FOH iMac.
