- Updated Ableton Live Preferences:

  - **File & Folder Settings:** The TEMP, CACHE, and USER folders were relocated to Blue from the local hard drive as the local hard drive is running low on space.  Blue can accommodate about 500 hours of full multi-track recording currently.  You can refer to the following preferences settings for their current locations:

    - Live --> Preferences --> File Folder Tab --> Temporary Folder
    - Live --> Preferences --> File Folder Tab --> Cache Folder
    - Live --> Preferences --> Library Tab --> Location of User Library

This was done to accommodate full-band rehearsal recording sessions.

- Created new page on [WIKI](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki) entitled [Ableton Live Notes](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/Ableton-Live-Notes)

- Updated Sidebar (Table of Contents):

  - Added [Ableton Live Notes](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki/Ableton-Live-Notes).
