	All updates were done to the best of our knowledge.
	
	The "last updated" field shows the date that any changes were made to the records.
	
	- Cleaned up Spreadsheet
	- Re-Imported current People database to spreadsheet.
	- Created `Unassigned Campus` list in PCPeople to find all people in the database who aren't assigned to a campus but **ARE** marked as being a member.
	- **Remember, in Planning Center, lists by default only include active records.**  If the person is marked inactive, you'll have to explicitly include them by checking the `include inactive profiles` checkbox when creating filter rules for a list.
	- All records marked as Members who are Active have been assigned to the Chandler Campus.
