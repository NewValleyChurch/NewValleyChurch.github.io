- Exported all people and imported to Google Sheets.
- Swept phone number fields to re-format all phone numbers to match the XXX-XXX-XXXX format.
- Created pivot tables to quickly see the count of people who are or are not members and are or are not designated with a gender.

Currently the project consists of updating the database so the records are accurate.
