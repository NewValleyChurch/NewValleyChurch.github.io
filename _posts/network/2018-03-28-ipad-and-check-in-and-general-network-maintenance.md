#### iPad2 Changes

- Configured iPad2 with a new name: Check-in iPad 2.  This is the new device name (network name).  The IP address for this device was set to static and is found on 192.168.0.175.
- Configured Check-In app:

Check-In iPad 2 is currently configured as the New Valley Kids 2 station as defined in Planning Center and is setup to print to the printer "Check-In Printer 2."  It is tested and is working properly.  The printer paper selection on this device needs to be set to DK-2205.

#### iPad1 Changes

Due to the fact that the iCloud account was previously connected to Heidi's old newvalley e-mail address and the recovery address was her personal e-mail, I'm currently going through the process of re-setting all of that information so we can get the printer working on the other laptop.  At present, it is locked out after re-setting the OS.  As soon as we have the correct information, we'll get it connected.

Received upated information from Heidi on Apple iCloud account, reset the password and secret questions and transferred the identity.

Also removed the iPad from the account but have run into another challenge.  The iPad itself is saying that it's under Activation Lock and must be unlocked with the previous user's password.  Testing the restore process now that the account has been switched to see if that works.

- 3:19PM Resolved iPad issue with iCloud.
- Setup iCloud account for iPad
- Downloaded and configured Check-Ins.  Station name is "New Valley Kids 1"  Printer is "Check-In Printer 1."
- Assigned static IP: 192.168.0.190 and named the device "Check-In iPad 1"

#### Check-Ins Update

Both iPads and Check-In printers are working.  One of the Brother printers has a different paper cartridge pattern on it than the other which is why printer 1 and printer 2 have different paper settings.  Printer 2 is DK-2205 and Printer 1 is DK-1202

#### Amanda's Workstation

Setup a static IP address on Amanda's workstation and enabled screen sharing for remote access.  192.168.0.164 is the internal IP address.

#### Additional

- Copied New Valley Logo artwork to iPads
- Mounted one iPad in new security mount.
