The New Valley Guest WIFI Network has been activated and can be found at:

New Valley Guest
Password: 'nvcguest'

The guest network operates on a different subnet than the main network, so you'll want to make a note of your wireless network profiles on your device(s) in the event that you connect to the guest network and still need access to resources on the main network.  You can't mix the two together currently.

If you do connect using your phone or tablet, etc., to the guest network and you need to access the printer, for example, you'll need to make sure you're on the main WIFI network.
