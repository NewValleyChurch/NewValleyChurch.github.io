## Purpose
To increase awareness of systems and procedures, and improve collaboration between mission critical teams, both staff, and volunteer.

This is currently a 100% volunteer based project that utilizes various online tools to track and assemble the information and attempts to solve [[The Problems]] we all face with communication and team collaboration.

## Participate

If you would like to collaborate on the documents here, please do so.

You can submit edits, create new pages, and discuss content regarding various pages there.

### Issues and Problems that need solving

If you want to [submit an issue](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/issues/) regarding something that you've discovered while serving on your team, [do that here](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/issues/).

## Special Considerations

- **Links that are red** link to pages that don't yet exist.  While writing, sometimes we think of potential new content that we would like to link to.  When you add text in brackets like this --> ```[[Text Here]]``` it becomes a link to a document that has not yet been created.

- **Change Logs**: Any time you edit a change log to leave notes about something, add the new entry at the top of the log so the most recent information is at the top, leaving the entire document in reverse chronological order.

- **Folder Structure** : A GitHub [WIKI](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki)'s folder structure is flat, meaning there are no visible folders or sub-folders when you see it online.  However, the files that we use to edit and update the [WIKI](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki) **_are_** organized into folders and sub-folders, purely for ease of editing.  When they are published, those folders and sub-folders have no bearing on the organization of the documents.  The only way to visually organize the [WIKI](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/Infrastructure/wiki) is to edit the _Sidebar.md_ file in the [Document Repository](https://github.com/NewValleyChurch/infrasctructure-docs).

## Basic Philosophy

Focus on the Why and the What and the How will take care of itself.

I believe that God created us for a specific purpose, and has given us a play book full of best practices.  I also believe that as we were created in His image, we also have the desire to create.  Some of the tools we have at our disposal, both software and hardware, were created with a purpose in mind, and a set of best practices.  It's very easy to cut corners when using these tools, but that tends to lead to disorganization and chaos, and away from excellence.  I adhere to the idea that doing things right the first time yields a higher level of excellence and a greater experience for everyone.  In order to achieve that, proper planning must occur.

- If it can be done right, do it right.
- If we don't know the theory of the design nor the purpose and full scope and capabilities of the tools, we commit to learning about it.
- Try, fail, document, learn, try again.
- Practice.
